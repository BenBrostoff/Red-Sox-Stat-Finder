red_sox_stat_finder
===================

A terminal app to find / sort team data by season on the Boston Red Sox. All data is per baseball-reference.com and can be found [here](http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BOS/). 

My approach was to take the CSV output from the link above and feed into a database using Ruby and the sqlite3 gem. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions / recommendations / etc.
